# VEGA Signing Example

This repository shows how to sign transactions against the [Vega vesting contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x23d1bFE8fA50a167816fBD79D7932577c06011f4) entirely offline using a Hexidecimal private key and Web3.

Check the script to see which constants need to be replaced, e.g. your private key needs to be provided.

The relevant source can be found in [stake_or_unstake.js](https://github.com/MM0819/vega-signing-example/blob/main/stake_or_unstake.js).
